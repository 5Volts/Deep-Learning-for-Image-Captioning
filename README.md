# Deep Learning for Image Captioning
Using a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and LSTM Recurrent Neural Network. We can put together a very awesome Deep Learning A.I. that can generate short descriptions from images.

# Get Started
## Dependencies
You'll need to have the following modules installed:
`tensorflow`
`numpy`
`opencv-python`
`sklearn`

If not just type `pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python sklearn` into your commandline.

## Using your own Image
Drag your photo into this directory. 
Then open up terminal and run `python inference.py --image_file your_image.jpg`.
